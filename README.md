# my-first-brute-force
test generate all possible words from chars or numbers or signs dynamic js (my first try with brute-force from scratch using nested loops and logical check statments)

mix of {brute-force} and {dictionary} attack it organized and full gotten as it 1 {dictionary} and it generate {all possible values of 3 attoms} (1 attom can be char), number, signs, or word!, or sentence!, or full big pragraph
(support infity attoms args, infity support infity size of string, max is 3 attoms not 3 length of final result).

### this dynamic same desgin pattern loops algo handle 1 2 so it not static result it static blocks atoms and logical and code for eachcase also helps in control easy the performance cpu execute only what needed and get it and no need any !INCLUDES CHECK MEAN 0

all can done of 3 atoms with minlength 1 (word 1char) and maxLength 3 (word 3chars) is 39

math confirm and forumla in math not logic and loops desgin

u control cpu from js as u execute only the needed to reach your target so 27 is only the will be alerted in all perocess for 1or 2or 3 length so it only execute generate for 3chars and not execute 1 or 2, same if target 1,2 it not execute 3 
#### Math rule 3 ** 3 == 27

## we deal with atoms when use desgin pattern so atom can be any char, num , anysymobl, or boyend burtne-forcer-dream static atom word such as (space pythonking space) always checked their posibilties and omit logical in other currents so treated as it char atom logically dynamic max

Atoms is desgin pattern and loop meaning
